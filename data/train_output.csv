[SEP] chapter xxxii it was the eve of the reopening of parliament . maraton , who had been absent from london - - no one knew where - - during the last six weeks , had suddenly reappeared . once more he had invited the committee of the labour party to meet at his house . his invitation was accepted , but it was obvious that this time their attitude towards the man who welcomed them was one of declared and pronounced hostility . graveling was there , with sullen , evil face . he made no attempt to shake hands with maraton , and he sat at the table provided for them with folded arms and dour , uncompromising aspect . dale came late and he , too , greeted maraton with bluff unfriendliness . borden ' s attitude was non - committal . weavel shook hands , but his frown and manner were portentous . culvain , the diplomat of the party , was quiet and reserved . david ross alone had never lost his attitude of unwavering fidelity . he sat at maraton ' s left hand , his head a little drooped , his eyes almost hidden beneath his shaggy grey eyebrows , his lower lip protuberant . he had , somehow , the air of a guarding dog , ready to spring into bitter words if his master were touched . "" gentlemen , "" maraton began , when at last they were all assembled , "" i have asked you , the committee who were appointed to meet me on my arrival england , to meet me once more here on the eve of the reopening of parliament . "" there was a grim silence . no one spoke . their general attitude was one of suspicious waiting . "" you all know , "" maraton went on , "" with what ideas i first came to england . i found , however , that circumstances here were in many respects different from anything i had imagined . you all know that i modified my plans . i decided to adopt a middle course"

"" even so , longley alley and other analysts expect the epilogue to be anything but predictable . there are plenty of competing elements left behind : the thousands of mainly young demonstrators who took to the streets of sanaa and other cities in january to demand democratic change , the tribal alliance that took up arms against saleh , secessionists in the south and a shiite rebellion in the north , well - organized islamist groups and a budding al qaeda franchise . perhaps the most powerful figure in yemen now is brig . gen . ali mohsen al - ahmar , commander of the 1st armored division . he defected in march and took a chunk of the army with him . his units now control northern districts of the capital and are facing off against powerful remnants of the saleh clan . the president ' s son , ahmed ali abdullah saleh , long groomed to be his successor , and his nephew , yahya muhammad saleh"
